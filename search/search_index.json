Mu is built around the idea that shipping and maintaining a UEFI product is an ongoing collaboration between numerous partners. For too long the industry has built products using a \"forking\" model combined with copy/paste/rename and with each new product the maintenance burden grows to such a level that updates are near impossible due to cost and risk. Project Mu also tries to address the complex business relationships and legal challenges facing partners today. To build most products it often requires both closed-source, proprietary assets as well as open source and industry standard code. The distributed build system and multi-repository design allow product teams to keep code separate and connected to their original source while respecting legal and business boundaries. Project Mu originated from building modern Windows PCs but its patterns and design allow it to be scaled down or up for whatever the final product's intent. IoT, Server, PC, or any other form factor should be able to leverage the content. Primary Goals \u00b6 Initially, this project will focus on two central goals. Share our active code tree to both solicit feedback and entice partners to collaborate \u00b6 Project Mu is an active project. This is not a side project, mirror, clone, or example. This is the same code used today on many of Microsoft's 1 st party devices and it will be kept current because it must be to continue to enable shipping products. Promote, evangelize, and support an industry shift to a more collaborative environment so we all can build and maintain products with lower costs and higher quality \u00b6 Today's open source projects although extremely valuable are very resource intensive to interact with. This friction leads to major industry players avoiding public interaction thus diminishing the overall community\u2019s value. The modern era of open source projects has incorporated new tools and procedures to lower this friction and it is our goal to leverage those tools. GitHub provides issue tracking, Pull Requests, Gated builds, tracked/required web-based code reviews, and CI/CD (Continuous builds and testing). It is our belief that by leveraging and extending this automation and workflow we can lower the friction and foster a safe place for all contributors to work. Guiding Principles \u00b6 Less is More * Be open to change / flexible - Keep learning. If it was easy this would have been solved before Design for code reuse Leverage tools / invest in automation Navigation \u00b6 Have a look around this site to see what is Project Mu.

It represents a variant of TianoCore that was customized within Microsoft for scaling and maintainability. It's not exactly a staging branch for TianoCore, as there are some changes that may not have application within or meet the explicit goals of that project, but it is a place where features and changes can be publicly featured and discussed. So, is this a fork? \u00b6 Not entirely. It is our goal to continue to treat TianoCore as a true upstream. Our release branches will always be based on the latest stable TianoCore release, and we will always try to PR viable fixes and features into the TianoCore project. What is it? Where is it going? \u00b6 Project Mu is a product of the Microsoft Core UEFI team and is the basis for the system firmware within a number of Microsoft products. It will continue to be maintained to reflect the FW practices and features leveraged for the best experience with Windows and other Microsoft products. A secondary purpose is to engage with the community, both in TianoCore and the industry at large. We hope that Project Mu serves as a concrete example for discussing different approaches to managing the challenges faced by the UEFI ecosystem. Content/Structure \u00b6 Is this really following \"Less is More\"? \u00b6 Yes. The idea is lowering the entanglement of code, lowering the coupling, and allowing the product to pick and choose the code it needs. This means when building any given product, you don't need all the Project Mu code. Why are there so many repos? \u00b6 Project Mu makes liberal use of multiple repositories due to the mixture of requirements in the UEFI ecosystem. Some repos are split for technical reasons, some for organizational, and some for legal.

There is a steep learning curve in UEFI and no amount of documentation will change that, but at a minimum quick, clear, and easy documentation can help everyone adopt features faster and with higher confidence. Our documentation system will focus on making this an easy, low friction, and collaborative process. The pull request process will eventually compel developers to submit documentation whenever they submit new components and refactoring. Documentation will be done in markdown as this has the benefit of being easily readable in both plain text as well as transformed into a richer experience. It also is quick to learn and to write. Currently, we leverage mkdocs as our publishing engine but since all content is in markdown it could be transitioned to another engine without significant reinvestment. Community documentation \u00b6 This content is documented in static markdown files within the Project Mu repository. We leverage mkdocs to generate web-hosted content on every change and host these using github.io. These static files focus on how the project and community interact. We strongly encourage contribution and follow the standard PR model for all changes, big and small. Developer documentation \u00b6 This content is documented in a couple of ways. There are static markdown files in the Project Mu repository. This contains details about high level concepts, howto articles, and features of the project and all repos within Project Mu. Examples: Code layout, git usage, tools, building, packaging, etc. There is repo and package level documentation for features. These are also static markdown files but these are contained within the repo that contains the feature. A \u201cdocs\u201d folder for each repo and each package will host this content. Changes will also follow the standard PR model for the containing repo. Next, there is feature and instance documentation. This should inform a developer interested in the implementation specifics of what this module is and what additional requirements it has including code dependencies and limitations. This should be documented in markdown files located with the component. These should be updated whenever the component is updated and should be part of a code PR. Finally, for API and traditional functional documentation, our current stance is this is required in code (public APIs) but the published documentation (doxygen html, pdf, etc) is not necessary. Code tools like vscode already provide a lower friction method to index, find def, and search that uses this content directly embedded in the code.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"DeveloperDocs/developer_docs/#developer-docs","text":"","title":"Developer Docs"},{"location":"DeveloperDocs/developer_docs/#philosophy","text":"Documentation is critical.

Code tools like vscode already provide a lower friction method to index, find def, and search that uses this content directly embedded in the code.","title":"Developer documentation"},{"location":"DeveloperDocs/doc_requirements/","text":"Requirements for contributing documentation \u00b6","title":"Documentation Requirements"},{"location":"DeveloperDocs/doc_requirements/#requirements-for-contributing-documentation","text":"","title":"Requirements for contributing documentation"},{"location":"DeveloperDocs/doc_sample_test/","text":"Documentation Sample / Test file / Advanced doc features \u00b6 mkdocs macros plugin \u00b6 This plugin allows providing some variables in mkdocs.yml file as well as python functions interpreted during the build process.

Each component is supported at its own schedule with new features and bug fixes, creating a problem of stale code if not synced up regularly. Compound the version and source problem with the sheer size: a common UEFI codebase is typically well above 1 million LOC and only goes up from there. What is a dependency \u00b6 To understand the layering you must first understand the terminology. There are two types of code assets. A definition of something. Generally, this is defined in an accessible header file. This is the API provided by some asset. This API can be \"depended\" upon to provide some capability. An implementation of something. Example of a dependency: DxeCore in the Basecore layer includes a TimerLib interface. TimerLib interface is defined in the same Basecore layer as DxeCore, so in this case a Basecore module is depending on a Basecore interface. This is allowed. Another example: Silicon-layer module implements a TimerLib interface defined in Basecore. Here, a Silicon layer module depends on a Basecore interface. This is allowed. Architecture \u00b6 Project Mu is an attempt to create a rigid layering scheme that defines the hierarchy of dependencies. Architectural goal kept in mind when designing this layering scheme is a controlled, limited scope, and allowed dependencies for each module within a given layer. It is important to know, when implementing a module, what the module is allowed to depend on. When creating an interface, it is important to identify the correct layer for it such that all the consuming modules are located in the layers below. Motivation and goals of the layering scheme: Easy component integration Code reuse Only carry relevant code Dependency Block Diagram \u00b6 File Layout \u00b6 To best preserve and delineate these concepts of componentization and unidirectional dependency, we have chosen to lay out our repository files in a structure that reinforces the same mentality. The underlying logic of this layout is to clearly distinguish each layer from the rest. As such, the Basecore -- which is considered foundational -- is broken out on its own, followed by the Common repos, followed by the Silicon, followed by the Platform. As mentioned elsewhere, Project Mu makes liberal use of multiple repositories due to the mixture of requirements in the firmware ecosystem. Some repos are split for technical reasons, some for organizational, and some for legal. One of the goals of Project Mu is to make this seemingly complicated layout easier to work with. Min Platform Example \u00b6 A simple tree might look like this... project_mu/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 Build/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 Common/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... # Common code optional, but probably not required \u251c\u2500\u2500 Conf/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 MU_BASECORE/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 Platform/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Sample/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 MyMinPlatform # Platform-specific build files and code \u251c\u2500\u2500 Silicon/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 SiProvider/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 REF_CODE/ # Enablement code for your architecture \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitattributes \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitmodules \u2514\u2500\u2500 bootstrap_repo.py Note that this file structure is likely located in a Git repository, and every \"ALL CAPS\" directory in this example is a Git submodule/nested repository.

Architectural goal kept in mind when designing this layering scheme is a controlled, limited scope, and allowed dependencies for each module within a given layer.

When creating an interface, it is important to identify the correct layer for it such that all the consuming modules are located in the layers below.

The underlying logic of this layout is to clearly distinguish each layer from the rest. As such, the Basecore -- which is considered foundational -- is broken out on its own, followed by the Common repos, followed by the Silicon, followed by the Platform. As mentioned elsewhere, Project Mu makes liberal use of multiple repositories due to the mixture of requirements in the firmware ecosystem.

The build system and firmware code for the project is hosted in a number of other repositories, grouped/divided by function, partner, license, and dependencies. Several of these repositories are brought together by the build system to create a FW project, but we'll get into those details later. ;) For now, an overview of the repositories and what code you'll find there... Mu Basecore \u00b6 This repository is considered foundational and fundamental to Project Mu. The guiding philosophy is that this code should be one or more of the following: Part of the build system Common to any silicon architecture Part of the \"API layer\" that contains protocol and library definitions including Industry Standards UEFI Specifications ACPI Specifications Part of the \"PI\" layer that contains driver dispatch logic, event/signaling logic, or memory management logic This can also include central technologies like variable services Mu Common Plus \u00b6 The packages found in this repository are contributed entirely by Project Mu. They should be common to all silicon architectures and only depend on Mu Basecore. These packages provide features and functionality that are entirely optional, but may be recommended for PC platform FW. Mu Tiano Plus \u00b6 This repository contains only modules that were originally sourced from TianoCore. They are not essential for any particular platform, but are likely useful to many platforms. The versions contained in this repo are modified and/or improved to work with the rest of Project Mu. Repo Philosophy \u00b6 Project Mu makes liberal use of multiple repositories due to the mixture of requirements in the UEFI ecosystem. Some repos are split for technical reasons, some for organizational, and some for legal. Examples of this are: A downstream contributor wants to add a generic feature with a silicon-specific implementation. This feature would be leveraged by Common code. If all code were in one repository, no barriers would be in place to prevent the contributor from directly calling from Common code into the Silicon implementation. By forcing the API/interface to be published in a separate repository, we can ensure that the unidirectional dependency relationship is maintained. Module A and Module B both provide optional functionality. However, Module A is far more likely to be consume by a wide audience than Module B. To achieve \"Less is More\", Module A may be placed in a different repos to enable downstream consumers to carry as little \"unused\" code as possible, since it's likely they would not need Module B in their code tree. A downstream consumer is producing a product in conjunction with a vendor/partner. While most of the enabling code for the vendor component is open-source, a portion of it is only released under NDA. By having multiple repositories comprise a single workspace, the downstream consumer is able to maximize their open-source consumption (which minimizes forking) while maintaining the legal requirements of closed-source/proprietary partitioning.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"WhatAndWhy/overview/#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"WhatAndWhy/overview/#project-organization","text":"This documentation is hosted in the main repository for Project Mu, which is used as a central collection point for community interaction and documentation.

It allows for unit test development to focus on the tests and leave, error logging, result formatting, context persistance, and test running to the framework. The unit test framework works well for low level unit tests as well as system level tests and fits easily in automation frameworks. The code is designed for a unit test application to leverage the framework which is made up of a number of libraries which allow for easy customization of the different elements. A few different instances are created to both show how easy some behaviors can be customized as well as provide different implementations that support different use cases. UnitTestLib \u00b6 The main \"framework\" library. This provides the framework init, suite init, and add test case functionality. It also supports the running of the suites and logging/reporting of results. UnitTestAssetLib \u00b6 The UnitTestAssetLib provides helper macros and functions for checking test conditions and reporting errors. Status and error info will be logged into the test context. There are a number of Assert macros that make the unit test code friendly to view and easy to understand. UnitTestBootUsbLib \u00b6 One of the unique features of the unit test framework is to be able to save text context and reboot the system. Since unit tests are generally run from a bootable usb key the framework has library calls to set boot next for usb. There is numerous ways this could be done on a given platform / BDS implementation and therefore this simple library allows customization if needed. This package supplies two instances: UsbClass Lib: This uses the Usb Class boot option as defined in the UEFI spec and leveraged by industry standard USB applications. UsbMicrosoft Lib: This uses a private boot option found in Microsoft UEFI to boot to usb UnitTestLogLib \u00b6 Library to support logging information during the test execution. This data is logged to the test context and will be available in the test reporting phase. This should be used for logging test details and helpful messages to resolve test failures. UnitTestResultReportLib \u00b6 Library provides function to run at the end of a framework test run and handles formatting the report. This is a common customization point and allows the unit test framework to fit its output reports into other test infrastructure. In this package a simple library instances has been supplied to output test results to the console as plain text. UnitTestPersistenceLib \u00b6 Persistence lib has the main job of saving and restoring test context to a storage medium so that for tests that require exiting the active process and then resuming state can be maintained. This is critical in supporting a system reboot in the middle of a test run. Samples \u00b6 There is a sample unit test provided as both an example of how to write a unit test and leverage many of the features of the framework. This sample can be found in the SampleUnitTestApp directory. Copyright \u00b6 Copyright \u00a9 2017, Microsoft Corporation All rights reserved.

DFCI provides multiple levels of delegated ownership, permissions, & PKI to enable a central device ownership authority to provision (and re-provision) to delegated owners as well as to provide multiple layers of recovery in case a delegated PKI either becomes unavailable or is compromised. DFCI can be configured to enable Zero-touch UEFI Management ( ZUM ). In this configuration, no consent prompt is presented to the physically-present user during enrollment of ownership authorities, as they are presumed to not be the device owner.

Processing of (signed) UEFI capsules at boot time and runtime 2. Scalable FMP architecture 3. Support for FMP capsules 4. Support for Windows Firmware Update Display capsules 5. Firmware update progress display (text or graphical) 6. Capsule update and FMP policies 7. Support for multiple capsule verification certificates 8. ESRT support Note: this package provides the entire framework for updating device firmware via capsules. No actual device firmware is updated or attempted to be updated by this implementation. Modules/Drivers \u00b6 EfiSystemResourceTableDxe.inf \u00b6 Implementation: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Universal\\EsrtDxe This driver adds EFI System Resource Table (ESRT) to the System Configuration Tables. It prints the entire ESRT table at debug output. This driver is added to the DSC and FDF files. This driver implementation differs from EDK2's implementation in that it simply consumes all FMP instances ( gEfiFirmwareManagementProtocolGuid ) and creates an ESRT entry for each FMP instance. Libraries \u00b6 FmpWrapperDeviceLib.inf \u00b6 LIBRARY_CLASS: FmpWrapperDeviceLib Definition: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Include\\Library\\FmpWrapperDeviceLib.h Implementation: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Library\\FmpWrapperDeviceLib.inf Implements common code included by all FMP wrapper drivers. In a scalable FMP architecture, there are one or more FMP wrapper drivers (e.g., for UEFI, ME, FW, etc.), each referring to its own FMP library instance, Device GUID, Device Name, Lowest Supported Version and update progress display color in the DSC file. Following is an example of relationship between an FMP driver and libraries: SampleDeviceLibWrapperFMP . inf ( FMP driver which is just a wrapper ) | v FmpWrapperDeviceLib . inf ( this common - code library included by the FMP driver ) | v SampleFmpDeviceLib . inf ( FMP instance unique to this FMP driver and implements all the required hooks ) DxeCapsuleLib.inf \u00b6 LIBRARY_CLASS: CapsuleLib Definition: MdeModulePkg\\Include\\Library\\CapsuleLib.h Implementation: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Library\\DxeCapsuleLib Implements entry points for processing capsules at boot time and runtime. ProcessCapsules() is an entry point for processing FMP and Windows Firmware Update Display capsules at boot time. ProcessCapsuleImage() is an entry point for processing FMP and Windows Firmware Update Display capsules at runtime. This library implementation is similar to EDK2's implementation, but with following differences/additions: not supporting drivers embedded in the capsule and only supporting one payload per capsule. DisplayUpdateProgressTextLib.inf \u00b6 LIBRARY_CLASS: DisplayUpdateProgressLib Definition: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Include\\Library\\DisplayUpdateProgressLib.h Implementation: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Library\\DisplayUpdateProgressTextLib Implements DisplayUpdateProgress() to display firmware update progress in text at console out. It is called from DxeCapsuleLib.inf. DisplayUpdateProgressGraphicsLib.inf \u00b6 LIBRARY_CLASS: DisplayUpdateProgressLib Definition: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Include\\Library\\DisplayUpdateProgressLib.h Implementation: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Library\\DisplayUpdateProgressGraphicsLib Implements DisplayUpdateProgress() to display firmware update progress in graphics (progress bar) at console out. It is called from DxeCapsuleLib.inf. This library requires a new protocol gEfiBootLogoProtocol2Guid , which is defined by this implementation in MdeModulePkg\\Include\\Protocol\\BootLogo2.h. MdeModulePkg\\Universal\\Acpi\\BootGraphicsResourceTableDxe\\BootGraphicsResourceTableDxe.inf driver has been changed to publish this new protocol and consequently is added to the DSC and FDF file. MdeModulePkg\\Library\\BootLogoLib\\BootLogoLib.inf driver has been changed to set boot logo data, which is then consumed by this library. CapsuleUpdatePolicyLibNull.inf \u00b6 LIBRARY_CLASS: CapsuleUpdatePolicyLib Definition: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Include\\Library\\CapsuleUpdatePolicyLib.h Implementation: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Library\\CapsuleUpdatePolicyLibNull Implements (null) interface for checking update policies such as power, thermal and system environment while updating device firmware. It is called from FmpWrapperDeviceLib.inf library. FmpPolicyDxeLib.inf \u00b6 LIBRARY_CLASS: FmpPolicyLib Definition: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Include\\Library\\FmpPolicyLib.h Implementation: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Library\\FmpPolicyLib Implements (null) interface for FMP policies such as whether to check for Lowest Supported Version (LSV) or to lock FMP device at ReadyToBoot event. This sample implementation will be replaced by platform specific implementation. BaseBmpSupportLib.inf \u00b6 LIBRARY_CLASS: BmpSupportLib Definition: MdeModulePkg\\Include\\Library\\BmpSupportLib.h Implementation: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Library\\BaseBmpSupportLib Converts BMP graphics image to GOP blt. It is called from DxeCapsuleLib.inf when processing Windows Firmware Update Display capsules. FmpHelperDxeLib.inf \u00b6 LIBRARY_CLASS: FmpHelperLib Definition: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Include\\Library\\FmpHelperLib.h Implementation: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Library\\FmpHelperLib Implements helper functions. MsFmpPayloadHeaderV1DxeLib.inf \u00b6 LIBRARY_CLASS: MsFmpPayloadHeaderLib Definition: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Include\\Library\\MsFmpPayloadHeaderLib.h Implementation: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Library\\MsFmpPayloadHeaderV1DxeLib Implements helper functions used by FmpWrapperDeviceLib library. It implements a (platform specific) header MS_FMP_PAYLOAD_HEADER above FMP payload containing version, LSV, etc. MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\MsCapsuleUpdatePkg.dsc & MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\MsCapsuleUpdatePkg.dec \u00b6 MsCapsuleUpdatePkg.dsc links all the required libraries for MsCapsuleUpdatePkg and compiles EfiSystemResourceTableDxe.inf driver. MsCapsuleUpdatePkg.dec lists of the libraries, GUIDs and PCDs used in the MsCapsuleUpdatePkg . Limitations \u00b6 Following are the limitations of this implementation: 1. Drivers embedded in the capsule are not supported/run. The reason for not supporting it is that this design assumes closed-system architecture where these drivers would run within trusted boundaries and the firmware is unprotected. So, any such driver approved by secure boot (or when secure boot is off), if allowed to run, can jeopardize the security of the system. 2. Only one payload per capsule is supported.

About \u00b6 MuCryptoDxe is a DXE_DRIVER you can include in your platform to have a protocol that can call Crypto functions without having to staticly link against the crypto library in many places Supported Architectures \u00b6 This package is not architecturally dependent. Methods supported \u00b6 There are two protocols exposed in this GUID _MU_PKCS5_PASSWORD_HASH_PROTOCOL \u00b6 HashPassword \u00b6 Hashes a password by passing through to the BaseCryptLib. Returns EFI_STATUS NOTE: DigestSize will be used to determine the hash algorithm and must correspond to a known hash digest size. Use standards. @retval EFI_SUCCESS Congratulations! Your hash is in the output buffer. @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER One of the pointers was NULL or one of the sizes was too large. @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER The hash algorithm could not be determined from the digest size. @retval EFI_ABORTED An error occurred in the OpenSSL subroutines. Inputs : IN CONST MU_PKCS5_PASSWORD_HASH_PROTOCOL IN UINTN PasswordSize IN CONST CHAR8 *Password IN UINTN SaltSize IN CONST UINT8 *Salt IN UINTN IterationCount IN UINTN DigestSize IN UINTN OutputSize OUT UINT8 *Output _MU_PKCS7_PROTOCOL \u00b6 Verify \u00b6 Verifies the validility of a PKCS#7 signed data as described in \"PKCS #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax Standard\". The input signed data could be wrapped in a ContentInfo structure. If P7Data, TrustedCert or InData is NULL, then return EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER. If P7Length, CertLength or DataLength overflow, then return EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER. If this interface is not supported, then return EFI_UNSUPPORTED. @retval EFI_SUCCESS The specified PKCS#7 signed data is valid. @retval EFI_SECURITY_VIOLATION Invalid PKCS#7 signed data. @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED This interface is not supported. Inputs: IN CONST MU_PKCS7_PROTOCOL IN CONST UINT8 *P7Data, IN UINTN P7DataLength, IN CONST UINT8 *TrustedCert, IN UINTN TrustedCertLength, IN CONST UINT8 *Data, IN UINTN DataLength (in bytes) VerifyEKU \u00b6 This function receives a PKCS7 formatted signature, and then verifies that the specified Enhanced or Extended Key Usages (EKU's) are present in the end-entity leaf signing certificate. Note that this function does not validate the certificate chain. Applications for custom EKU's are quite flexible. For example, a policy EKU may be present in an Issuing Certificate Authority (CA), and any sub-ordinate certificate issued might also contain this EKU, thus constraining the sub-ordinate certificate. Other applications might allow a certificate embedded in a device to specify that other Object Identifiers (OIDs) are present which contains binary data specifying custom capabilities that the device is able to do. @retval EFI_SUCCESS - The required EKUs were found in the signature. @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - A parameter was invalid. @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND - One or more EKU's were not found in the signature.

No actual device firmware is updated or attempted to be updated by this implementation. Modules/Drivers \u00b6 SampleDeviceLibWrapperFMP.inf \u00b6 Implementation: MsSampleFmpDevicePkg\\SampleDeviceLibWrapperFmpDxeDriver A sample FMP wrapper driver. A device in the system may implement its own FMP wrapper driver, which installs Firmware Management Protocol (FMP) for this device. In a scalable FMP architecture, there are one or more FMP wrapper drivers (e.g., for UEFI, ME, FW, etc.), each referring to its own FMP library instance, Device GUID, Device Name, Lowest Supported Version and update progress display color in the DSC file. These drivers may be included in the FDF file. Libraries \u00b6 SampleFmpDeviceLib.inf \u00b6 LIBRARY_CLASS: FmpDeviceLib Definition: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Include\\Library\\FmpDeviceLib.h Implementation: MsSampleFmpDevicePkg\\Library\\SampleFmpDeviceLib.inf Implements a sample FMP instance included by the SampleDeviceLibWrapperFMP.inf driver above. This library defines a set of functions called by MsCapsuleUpdatePkg FmpWrapperDeviceLib.inf library, which in turn is included by FMP wrapper drivers. Each FMP wrapper driver will include a unique FMP library instance. Following is an example of relationship between an FMP driver and libraries: SampleDeviceLibWrapperFMP . inf ( FMP driver which is just a wrapper ) | v FmpWrapperDeviceLib . inf ( MsCapsuleUpdatePkg common - code library included by the FMP driver ) | v SampleFmpDeviceLib . inf ( FMP instance unique to this FMP driver and implements all the required hooks ) CapsuleKeyBaseLib.inf \u00b6 LIBRARY_CLASS: CapsuleKeyLib Definition: MsCapsuleUpdatePkg\\Include\\Library\\CapsuleKeyLib.h Implementation: MsSampleFmpDevicePkg\\Library\\CapsuleKeyBaseLib Contains public key certificates used for authenticating development and/or production capsules.

Each FMP wrapper driver including SampleDeviceLibWrapperFMP.inf will refer to its own FMP library instance, Device GUID, Device Name, Lowest Supported Version, update progress display color and whether system reset is required after the device update (an example shown below). Nt32PkgMsCapsule.fdf include SampleDeviceLibWrapperFMP.inf, EfiSystemResourceTableDxe.inf and BootGraphicsResourceTableDxe.inf drivers in the final firmware image. MsSampleFmpDevicePkg.dsc links all the required libraries for MsSampleFmpDevicePkg and MsCapsuleUpdatePkg and compiles SampleDeviceLibWrapperFMP.inf driver. Each FMP wrapper driver including SampleDeviceLibWrapperFMP.inf will refer to its own FMP library instance, Device GUID, Device Name, Lowest Supported Version, update progress display color and whether system reset is required after the device update (an example shown below).

Example: fs0:>FMPTestApp.efi -l -c 3rdPartyProductionCapsule.cap Option -l above is required when using MsCapsuleUpdatePkg DisplayUpdateProgressGraphicsLib library in the nt32 platform. This option displays the logo first and then displays the update progress bar relative to that logo. In order for these capsules to work successfully in nt32 platform, the capsules generated above do not set CAPSULE_FLAGS_PERSIST_ACROSS_RESET or CAPSULE_FLAGS_INITIATE_RESET flags and thus do not require warm reset. For production systems, these flags may need to be set (see the capsule generating batch files for more info). Creating Windows Capsules \u00b6 Windows capsules can be created by running MsSampleFmpDevicePkg\\Tools\\CreateWindowsCapsule.py tool (which uses CreateWindowsInf.py). Windows capsule files (*.inf, *.cat and .cap/ .bin) are created in MsSampleFmpDevicePkg\\Tools\\WindowsCapsule folder. Limitations \u00b6 Following are the limitations of this implementation: 1. When using nt32 platform, the capsules cannot be tested on the next reboot (see above for more info). Copyright \u00b6 Copyright \u00a9 2017, Microsoft Corporation All rights reserved.

This information is put into an XML file that allows for easy comparison and programmatic auditing. UEFI \u00b6 UEFI shell application that gets the current variable information from the UEFI shell and creates an XML file. Windows \u00b6 Python script that can be run from the Windows OS. It takes the UEFI created XML file as input and then queries all listed variables and updates the XML with access and status codes. This gives additional verification for variables that may employ late locking or other protections from OS access. TpmEventLogAudit \u00b6 Audit tool to collect the TPM Event Log from the system in standard format. It can then be programmatically compared against a known event log for the given system. Easy this that can be tested are the number of events in some PCRs, confirm that all PCRs should be capped, etc. SMMPagingAudit \u00b6 Audit tool creates a human readable description of the SMM page tables and memory environment. App \u00b6 UEFI shell application collects information from SMM and writes it to files. SMM \u00b6 SMM Library linked into SMM driver used to collect information about SMM environment. Activated by the shell app collects IDT, GDT, page tables, and loaded images.

In this environment nearly all system state can be inspected including that of the operating system, kernel, and hypervisor. Due to it's capabilities SMM has become an area of interest for those searching to exploit the system.

It is recommended that this driver should only be used on debug builds as it reports the entire SMM memory environment to the caller. The shell app will communicate to the SMM driver and request critical memory information including IDT, GDT, page tables, and loaded images. App \u00b6 The UEFI shell application collects system information from the DXE environment and then communicates to the SMM driver/handler to collect necessary info from SMM. It then writes this data to files and then that content is used by the windows scripts.

Xml brings value in that there are numerous, robust, readily available parsing solutions in nearly every environment, language, and operating system. The UEFI support is limited in that it only supports the ASCII strings and does not support XSD, schema, namespaces, or other extensions to XML. XmlTreeLib \u00b6 The XmlTreeLib is the cornerstone of this package. It provides functions for: * Reading and parsing XML strings into an XML node/tree structure * Creating or altering xml nodes within a tree * Writing xml nodes/trees to ASCII string * Escaping and Un-Escaping strings XmlTreeQueryLib \u00b6 The XmlTreeQueryLib provides very basic and simple query functions allowing code to interact with the XmlTree to do things like: * Find the first child element node with a name equal to the parameter * Find the first attribute node of a given element with a name equal to the parameter UnitTestResultReportLib \u00b6 A UnitTestResultReportLib that formats the results in XML using the JUnit defined schema. This instance allows the UEFI Unit Test Framework to integrate results with existing tools and other frameworks. Testing \u00b6 There are UEFI shell application based unit tests for each library. These tests attempt to verify basic functionality of public interfaces. Check the UnitTests folder at the root of the package. Developer Notes \u00b6 These libraries have known limitations and have not been fully vetted for un-trusted input. If used in such a situation it is suggested to validate the input before leveraging the XML libraries. With that said the ability to use xml in UEFI has been invaluable for building features and tests that interact with code running in other environments. The parser has been tuned to fail fast and in invalid XML just return NULL. Copyright \u00b6 Copyright \u00a9 2017, Microsoft Corporation All rights reserved.

Each ssl_*.conf.in file contains a number of test configurations. These files are used to generate testcases in the OpenSSL CONF format. The precise test output can be dependent on the library configuration. The test harness generates the output files on the fly. However, for verification, we also include checked-in configuration outputs corresponding to the default configuration. These testcases live in test/ssl-tests/*.conf files. For more details, see ssl-tests/01-simple.conf.in for an example. Configuring the test \u00b6 First, give your test a name. The names do not have to be unique. An example test input looks like this: { name => \"test-default\", server => { \"CipherString\" => \"DEFAULT\" }, client => { \"CipherString\" => \"DEFAULT\" }, test => { \"ExpectedResult\" => \"Success\" }, } The test section supports the following options Test mode \u00b6 Method - the method to test. One of DTLS or TLS. HandshakeMode - which handshake flavour to test: Simple - plain handshake (default) Resume - test resumption RenegotiateServer - test server initiated renegotiation RenegotiateClient - test client initiated renegotiation When HandshakeMode is Resume or Renegotiate, the original handshake is expected to succeed. All configured test expectations are verified against the second handshake. ApplicationData - amount of application data bytes to send (integer, defaults to 256 bytes). Applies to both client and server. Application data is sent in 64kB chunks (but limited by MaxFragmentSize and available parallelization, see below). MaxFragmentSize - maximum send fragment size (integer, defaults to 512 in tests - see SSL_CTX_set_max_send_fragment for documentation). Applies to both client and server. Lowering the fragment size will split handshake and application data up between more SSL_write calls, thus allowing to exercise different code paths. In particular, if the buffer size (64kB) is at least four times as large as the maximum fragment, interleaved multi-buffer crypto implementations may be used on some platforms. Test expectations \u00b6 ExpectedResult - expected handshake outcome. One of Success - handshake success ServerFail - serverside handshake failure ClientFail - clientside handshake failure InternalError - some other error ExpectedClientAlert, ExpectedServerAlert - expected alert. See ssl_test_ctx.c for known values. Note: the expected alert is currently matched against the last received alert (i.e., a fatal alert or a close_notify ). Warning alert expectations are not yet supported. (A warning alert will not be correctly matched, if followed by a close_notify or another alert.) ExpectedProtocol - expected negotiated protocol. One of SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2. SessionTicketExpected - whether or not a session ticket is expected Ignore - do not check for a session ticket (default) Yes - a session ticket is expected No - a session ticket is not expected ResumptionExpected - whether or not resumption is expected (Resume mode only) Yes - resumed handshake No - full handshake (default) ExpectedNPNProtocol, ExpectedALPNProtocol - NPN and ALPN expectations. ExpectedTmpKeyType - the expected algorithm or curve of server temp key Configuring the client and server \u00b6 The client and server configurations can be any valid SSL_CTX configurations. For details, see the manpages for SSL_CONF_cmd . Give your configurations as a dictionary of CONF commands, e.g. server => { \"CipherString\" => \"DEFAULT\", \"MinProtocol\" => \"TLSv1\", } The following sections may optionally be defined: server2 - this section configures a secondary context that is selected via the ServerName test option. This context is used whenever a ServerNameCallback is specified. If the server2 section is not present, then the configuration matches server. resume_server - this section configures the client to resume its session against a different server. This context is used whenever HandshakeMode is Resume. If the resume_server section is not present, then the configuration matches server. resume_client - this section configures the client to resume its session with a different configuration. In practice this may occur when, for example, upgraded clients reuse sessions persisted on disk. This context is used whenever HandshakeMode is Resume. If the resume_client section is not present, then the configuration matches client. Configuring callbacks and additional options \u00b6 Additional handshake settings can be configured in the extra section of each client and server: client => { \"CipherString\" => \"DEFAULT\", extra => { \"ServerName\" => \"server2\", } } Supported client-side options \u00b6 ClientVerifyCallback - the client's custom certificate verify callback. Used to test callback behaviour. One of None - no custom callback (default) AcceptAll - accepts all certificates. RejectAll - rejects all certificates. ServerName - the server the client should attempt to connect to. One of None - do not use SNI (default) server1 - the initial context server2 - the secondary context invalid - an unknown context CTValidation - Certificate Transparency validation strategy. One of None - no validation (default) Permissive - SSL_CT_VALIDATION_PERMISSIVE Strict - SSL_CT_VALIDATION_STRICT Supported server-side options \u00b6 ServerNameCallback - the SNI switching callback to use None - no callback (default) IgnoreMismatch - continue the handshake on SNI mismatch RejectMismatch - abort the handshake on SNI mismatch BrokenSessionTicket - a special test case where the session ticket callback does not initialize crypto. No (default) Yes Mutually supported options \u00b6 NPNProtocols, ALPNProtocols - NPN and ALPN settings. Server and client protocols can be specified as a comma-separated list, and a callback with the recommended behaviour will be installed automatically. Default server and client configurations \u00b6 The default server certificate and CA files are added to the configurations automatically. Server certificate verification is requested by default. You can override these options by redefining them: client => { \"VerifyCAFile\" => \"/path/to/custom/file\" } or by deleting them client => { \"VerifyCAFile\" => undef } Adding a test to the test harness \u00b6 Add a new test configuration to test/ssl-tests , following the examples of existing *.conf.in files (for example, 01-simple.conf.in ). Generate the generated *.conf test input file. You can do so by running generate_ssl_tests.pl : $ ./config $ cd test $ TOP = .. perl -I testlib/ generate_ssl_tests.pl ssl-tests/my.conf.in \\ > ssl-tests/my.conf where my.conf.in is your test input file. For example, to generate the test cases in ssl-tests/01-simple.conf.in , do $ TOP = .. perl -I testlib/ generate_ssl_tests.pl ssl-tests/01-simple.conf.in > ssl-tests/01-simple.conf Alternatively (hackish but simple), you can comment out unlink glob $tmp_file; in test/recipes/80-test_ssl_new.t and run $ make TESTS = test_ssl_new test This will save the generated output in a *.tmp file in the build directory. Update the number of tests planned in test/recipes/80-test_ssl_new.t . If the test suite has any skip conditions, update those too (see test/recipes/80-test_ssl_new.t for details). Running the tests with the test harness \u00b6 HARNESS_VERBOSE=yes make TESTS=test_ssl_new test Running a test manually \u00b6 These steps are only needed during development. End users should run make test or follow the instructions above to run the SSL test suite. To run an SSL test manually from the command line, the TEST_CERTS_DIR environment variable to point to the location of the certs. E.g., from the root OpenSSL directory, do $ CTLOG_FILE = test/ct/log_list.conf TEST_CERTS_DIR = test/certs test/ssl_test \\ test/ssl-tests/01-simple.conf or for shared builds $ CTLOG_FILE = test/ct/log_list.conf TEST_CERTS_DIR = test/certs \\ util/shlib_wrap.sh test/ssl_test test/ssl-tests/01-simple.conf Note that the test expectations sometimes depend on the Configure settings. For example, the negotiated protocol depends on the set of available (enabled) protocols: a build with enable-ssl3 has different test expectations than a build with no-ssl3 . The Perl test harness automatically generates expected outputs, so users who just run make test do not need any extra steps. However, when running a test manually, keep in mind that the repository version of the generated test/ssl-tests/*.conf correspond to expected outputs in with the default Configure options. To run ssl_test manually from the command line in a build with a different configuration, you may need to generate the right *.conf file from the *.conf.in input first.","title":"test"},{"location":"dyn/mu_tiano_plus/CryptoPkg/Library/OpensslLib/openssl/test/README.ssltest/#ssl-tests","text":"SSL testcases are configured in the ssl-tests directory.

For example, to generate the test cases in ssl-tests/01-simple.conf.in , do $ TOP = .. perl -I testlib/ generate_ssl_tests.pl ssl-tests/01-simple.conf.in > ssl-tests/01-simple.conf Alternatively (hackish but simple), you can comment out unlink glob $tmp_file; in test/recipes/80-test_ssl_new.t and run $ make TESTS = test_ssl_new test This will save the generated output in a *.tmp file in the build directory.

End users should run make test or follow the instructions above to run the SSL test suite. To run an SSL test manually from the command line, the TEST_CERTS_DIR environment variable to point to the location of the certs. E.g., from the root OpenSSL directory, do $ CTLOG_FILE = test/ct/log_list.conf TEST_CERTS_DIR = test/certs test/ssl_test \\ test/ssl-tests/01-simple.conf or for shared builds $ CTLOG_FILE = test/ct/log_list.conf TEST_CERTS_DIR = test/certs \\ util/shlib_wrap.sh test/ssl_test test/ssl-tests/01-simple.conf Note that the test expectations sometimes depend on the Configure settings. For example, the negotiated protocol depends on the set of available (enabled) protocols: a build with enable-ssl3 has different test expectations than a build with no-ssl3 . The Perl test harness automatically generates expected outputs, so users who just run make test do not need any extra steps. However, when running a test manually, keep in mind that the repository version of the generated test/ssl-tests/*.conf correspond to expected outputs in with the default Configure options. To run ssl_test manually from the command line in a build with a different configuration, you may need to generate the right *.conf file from the *.conf.in input first.","title":"Running a test manually"},{"location":"dyn/mu_tiano_plus/CryptoPkg/UnitTests/VerifyPkcs7EkuUnitTestApp/readme/","text":"Verify Pkcs7 Enhanced Key Usage Unit Test App \u00b6 Testing the verification of Enhanced Key Usages in PKCS7 formatted signatures.
